The primary function of MoraLife is to allow Users to have an easy method of keeping track of your day-to-day moral and immoral behavior. &nbsp;If we, as a society, are compelled to track our weight, money and leisure, we should be able to track our ethics as well. &nbsp;MoraLife attempts to provide that in as compassionate a way as possible.<br />
